##Nikolay Stoyanov

I am a full-stack junior software engineer who is really eager to join a software engineering team and gain more tech skills and contribute to my work team and the business.I've got a positive and really great attitude willing to challenge myself on a daily basis.

Outside of work I enjoy bike riding, indoor and outdoor rock climbing,Hiking, comping and travelling abroad.

Good communication skill's

During my previous carer as a commercial electrical engineer within corporate critical environment I'v had the chance to work for great clients like "Sun, Oracle, Hewlett Packard, GlobalSwitch, Sungard Availability Services, Harrods ".Working for eight years full time for  companies like those and especially within the critical environment really developed myself as a disciplined hard worker who is able to work under high demand.Also I'v developed good communication skills.
I strongly believe that my previous work and live experience would help me to progress very quick to a higher level software engineer and collaborate to the company I am working for.

Great ability to carry out direct instructions following strict scopes and best practices.
Iv developed this skill working with a number of consultants carrying out different projects.
